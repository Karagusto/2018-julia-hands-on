    "Dr. **André Lage-Freitas** is an Assistant Professor of Universidade Federal de Alagoas (UFAL) and member of LaCCAN lab (Laboratório de Computação Científica e Análise Numérica). He also holds a Ph.D. in Computer Science from the _Institut National des Sciences Appliquées de Rennes_ (INRIA, France), a Master Degree in computer Science from the Universitée de Rennes 1 (France) and a Bachelor Degree in Computer Science from the Universidade Federal da Bahia (Brazil). The main research problem he is working on is how to ease the use of Cloud computing infrastructures for Data Science applications by focusing on big remote sensing data sets. Dr. André Lage-Freitas has experience in international research projects such as CloudArray project (coordinator) funded by Microsoft Azure Research and further international projects funded by European Union and Latin America, e.g., [EOxposure H2020](http://www.h2020-eoxposure.eu), [S-CUBE FP7](http://www.s-cube-network.eu), [CONICYT](http://www.conicyt.cl) (Chile), and [FAPEAL](http://www.fapeal.br) (Brazil). He reviews research projects for [FAPESP](http://www.fapesp.br) (São Paulo Research Foundation) and he is a reviewer of the [IEEE Geoscience and Remote Sensing Letters journal](). He held for two years the Research Coordinator position under the UFAL Vice-Presidency of Research and Graduate Course. He is member of the [IEEE](https://www.ieee.org) and of the [SBC](http://sbc.org.br) (Sociedade Brasileira de Computação). He is Counsellor of [IEEE-UFAL Student Branch](http://sites.ieee.org/sb-ufal/) and [Enactus UFAL](http://enactus.org).\n",

    "**Charles Novaes de Santana** is a Computer Scientist with experience in Computer Modeling using concepts of Artificial Inteligence and Complex Systems to answer to Interdisciplinary questions. He holds a PhD in Climate Change by the University Menéndez Pelayo (Spain, 2013), a MsC in Climate change by the same university (2009) and a MsC in Environmental Sciences by the Universidade Estadual de Feira de Santana (Brazil, 2007). During last 5 years he has been working as Postdoctoral Researcher at different institutions in Switzerland (Eawag, UZH, ETH) and in Brazil (UEFS) as well as he has dedicated time to create a technological-based company with focus in Data Science: [DataSCOUT - Data Science and sCientific COmpUting](http://www.datascout.com.br). He has used Julia in different scientific projects in Ecology and in Complex Systems. Currently, his main research topic is the evolution of biodiversity in changing landscapes, using paleo-climatic reconstruction to understand biodiversity dynamics and climate forecast to understand the effects of climate change in this biodiversity. When he is not playing god with a computer and datasets, he is enjoying life with his beautiful daughter and wife. \"La vida son dos días\".\n",
